# Characters
These are some of the characters (at level 1) used by my players. They are in XML format suitable for 
use with Game Master 5e.app, available for macOS and iOS. 

Gondor, the dwarven cleric, is a worshipper of the Dwarven God, Karl. As a matter of the Dwarven scripture,
Karl is believed to be one of the first Dwarves to delve under the Earth. He was the first dwarf to 
discover cave gas, and ascended shortly thereafter as the Dwarven god of Light and Surprise when it
exploded. His holy days are frequently celebrated with fireworks and mushrooms. The exact role of
mushrooms in His religious services is a closely guarded secret of the Grag Karl sect. Public observances
can border on the mischievous, with frequent use of small pyrotechnics used to engender surprise and 
(de?)light in their victims. 

Aspen aims to be a Gloom stalker ranger some day, and really wants a pet panther, but is so far
not quite sure on the right mechanic to make that happen. She does not care for dogs. 

Caric Starfall, Sorceror extraordinare's most notable feature is brilliant blue skin, the result
of a previously undescribed magical accident. He specializes in luck, so while not necessarily 
particularly talented, might possibly be quite successful nonetheless.
