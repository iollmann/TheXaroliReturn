# SPQL (_Senatus Publicusque Legitus_)

SPQL is the abbreviation of the Hierophancist State, their most holy institution. The 
abbreviation is to be found on public buildings, some army materials, public works and
legislation.

Between the Dam and the new course of the Rodoethian river is a camp of a division of
the Army of the Hierophancy. The army is less religious than the order, and professionally
prosecutes war as required and also may supervise certain engineering projects during 
peace time, such as roadbuilding, and public works like aquaducts.  This is the only 
division assigned to the Rodoethian Valley. Since it is a peaceful place, it has served
mostly to provide security for the Relecno Gnome family, and administer the public 
works project for the dam.

There are several activities going on here not administered by SPQL, however. These 
include managing the Tawny Stoolabrabs, harvesting Allufurt fronts from the Eemaws fowl 
and running a small fishing fleet to harvest the gnimmuh fish to feed the less favored
workers. Because of its initial role in constructing the dam, the SPQL is still 
administering the slave pits and acquisitions. For other matters, the players will be 
referred off to the estate in the village further downstream, or to the Relecno foreman,
Master Gan stationed here in camp.

>_Your party arrives at the camp between the dam and the newly created Rodoehtian River 
falls and are noticed by two guards standing near where you stepped from the river. They 
wear tarnished bronze breastplates with leather pauldrons and a leather kilt with metal 
studs hanging down, a plumed helm. Each has a short sword and a very big tower shield. 
They wear them like the've been on campaign for a dozen years, which perhaps they have.
They eye you skeptically, but one raises an eyebrow when he sees Gronk tied up behind you._  

>_"You had better come with us," he says._

>_You are led through a small grid of four man tents to a larger tend with two more 
soldiers standing guard outside. The letters "SPQL" are stamped in square blocky type
above the door. They quietly exchange words with your escort, and then step aside to allow 
you in._ 

>_Inside the tent it is dimly lit, and your eyes take a moment to adjust. You see two 
men standing within. One is wearing a shinier bronze breastplate with a short sword
at his waist. His helmet with a tall white brush sits upon a well worn but nicely made
travellers writing desk. A small cup with a quill and inkwell sits on one corner next
to his help. A wooden chair sits behind the desk. To the right is a cot and a chest. 
The other man wears a toga and sandals. He has a golden bracelet on the right hand with 
the symbol of a balance for weighing goods. He smiles at you but steps off to the 
corner. This clearly isn't his show._

>_The old soldier looks at your company for a long minute, taking in every detail. You self
consciously realize just how an unusual group you are, even for adventurers. You certainly 
would stand out in a crowd. You'd stand out at a circus! As his eyes pass over Gronk, he 
pauses and raises an eyebrow, and then continues to survey the party. "I am Militarus 
Molitus. I am in charge here. This is Legitus Legitus, a priest. What is your name?"_

>_After introductions, he says "Hello, Gronk. You, I know"  Gronk had been up until this 
point trying to look very small and inconspicuous, not an easy feat for a bound seven foot 
bugbear hiding behind the company of Small and Smaller. Gronk emits a low grunt. His eyes 
follow the rope from Gronk to the adventurer who holds it. "What business do you have with 
Gronk here?"_

>_Gronk mumbles some unintelligible grunts. He is clearly not happy to be here. "Yes, well 
you are alive. I gather they could have left you for dead, and I dare say you would be, 
too. However did they...? Never-mind. Also, there is the contract, as you know. The 
Tribunal would have my helm if I ignored it." The priest gave Molitus a dark glance
at the words. "You are going to have to find a way to earn it back." Gronk scoffs 
angrily at the thought._

>_"I can give you 50 gold for the bugbear. Gronk will be a VERY helpful addition to our
workforce, won't you Gronk. Its the least I can do. What about these other men with you?
From the marks on their ankles and wrists, I gather they are not part of your team?"_
