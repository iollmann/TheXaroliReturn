_Dear Adventurer,_

Let your worries disappear and your imagination fade to white, a misty, soothing fog 
entirely free of... well, whatever unimportant thing was occupying your attention until now. 
Imagine instead, the bright and colorful Land of Leseig, where the colors are bright and the 
land is, well, colorful! People and creatures of every description inhabit the land,
some of whom you will meet in this very tale, should you survive so long. You are in for 
a treat as Leseig is a land of adventure, drama, heroic tales and one very, very clever Gnome. 

Narrow your attention now to one of the larger nations within Leseig, the Heirophancy of 
Whom, home of this Gnome -- at least up until recently. The Hierophancy has always been a nation 
of strife, contention and chaos. This may seem a bit unexpected for a nation ruled by a 
Cleric of Law, the Hierphant Supreme, Legis Lator[1] Primus to the Senate and final interpretor of 
The Law. For in the Heirophancy, the law is everything. The Law is All.[3] 

Alas, in practice, the difference between scripture and practice is that practice is not 
always right. Much to the clergy's dismay (if not actual surprise), not every citizen 
seems to fully understand law. However unambiguous and detailed -- _oh so detailed!_ -- the 
Hierphant Supreme may craft The Law to be, when applied to practical citizenry, The Law 
nonetheless ends up in dispute! And lo, the Angel of Adjudicated Tort shall come unto 
them with a summons. Absolutely everybody who is anybody (i.e. the unincarcerated) must be 
_de facto_ competent attorneys, courtroom drama being the main product of the economy. Even 
good meaning citizens may find themselves needing to sue their neighbors to determine who 
has right of way on the sidewalk on market day. Addressing the court is one of the main forms
of religious observance in the Hierophancy. The patron saints are named the Amicus Curiae. 
You get the idea.

>  **ADVERTISEMENT:**  __A prize of 10,000 gold coins and a 50 acre estate to the 
inventor of a automaton to advise each citizen of his legal duties and obligations
through the course of the day. The automoton shall have comprehensive, up to date,
knowledge of the law and the ability to understand the actions of the citizen and 
advise him of his legal duties. The automoton shall also be capable of instantaneously
transmitting a list of legal transgressions to Central Authority in real time, and 
assist law enforcement as necessary. Additional moneys will be provided for models 
with crossbows, halberds, morning stars, or CodeHammers[2] as needed to ensure legal 
conformance.__ _This message printed in conformance with subsec16.p2.s1198(431)
of the Holy Code._

Widen again to consider how the Heirophancy's neighbor states deal with all this... 
enthusiasm. While treaties are an proven way to establish peaceful relations between nation 
states and, of anyone, the Heirophancy can certainly be relied to follow the treaty _to the 
letter_, treaties with the Heirophancy tend to be __detailed__. Very detailed. Sufficiently 
DETAILED that if a would be transgressor had taken the time to fully read and understand 
the treaty, he wouldn't have time to transgress in the first place. (This is at least the 
Hierophancy's reasoning.) Alas, rulers of other lands, being creatures of privilege, largely 
don't have time for this (or don't think they do) and so demand the _abridged version_. 

...ohh, my...

As you may surely imagine, dear adventurer, using the abridged version is one of the 19 
deadly sins according to the 113th catechism of the Heirophant, before ignoring a summons 
and right after representing yourself in court. It is usually sufficient to enrage the 
citizenry (again, i.e. the unincarcerated) to war! This is where the Relecno _Gnome_ family 
comes in.

Well, not quite.  The Relocno Gnome family -- I bet you thought I had forgotten about
Gnomes! The Hierophancy never forgets about crime -- initially made their fame and fortune 
as master craftsmen of legal contracts with traps so diabolical, they rivaled the infernal 
contracts written in the Nine Hells themselves.[5] This proved to be so lucrative that after 
many decades they grew wealthy enough to become Bankers and Accountants to the Hierophancy,
a monopoly granted in recognition of their ability to finance (at reasonable rates) the many
Wars of the Hierophancy. So a Gnomish family to rival the Medici and Rothchild was born.

Though citizens of the Hierophant, the Relecno Gnome family have never been as devout in
their observance as the Hierophancy itself. It might be said they serve another God. Some
leading family members have been reported to have eyes that look like golden coins, though 
learned scholars point out that this is often associated with back reflection due to infravision.  
It is widely agreed one should never go up against a Relecno when money is on the line. So, 
what is a clever fellow to do, when all his brothers and sisters are Relecno? Well, as the 
great  man once said, "Go East, young man! Go East!" and so Eht Relecno did.

Its probably not possible to understand this story without understanding the geography
of the Hierophancy, or at least our corner of it. The nation itself is not unlike Gaul. It
has many rivers, forests and abundant farming lands. There are beaches, plains and hills. 
In another view, it might be a bit like Mordor, with mountains all around. So lets call it 
Gaulish Mordor, or perhaps Mordorian Gaul. The key takeaway here is that the mountains 
in the south east corner are especially tall. They are really tall, like Tibetian plateau 
tall. It is with this plateau that Mr Relecno was principally headed. It's one of those 
places that is so high that ordinary folks can't support a pregnancy. So, while  it certainly
was within the rights of the Heirophancy of Whom to rule the upland plateau of Usses, in 
reality it was much harder to maintain a permanent presence there. Eager young Hierophants 
would soon discover they were exhausted all the time. Their wives and families wouldn't join
them. The men struggled to complete basic tasks. It was a lot of work for what was a very rural,
mostly empty plateau, and as often as not the expedition would give up in disgust after a 
few months and return home. 

The Usses uplands are best described as a large high mountain valley. Above it tower some
of the Lands' greatest peaks, but the bottom is glacially carved, U-shaped and generally
flat. It is suitable for farming for those with the stamina to push a plow at altitude, 
and a gentle river runs through it. It was far enough north that the cold Southern winters 
do not fill it with snow year around.

[2] _A code hammer is a war hammer, traditionally with a paragraph of holy legal text printed 
backward on each face. When employed skillfully, the holy scripture shall be embossed 
on the person of a transgressor with each blow. Some hammers have as many as 15 faces 
for legal paragraphs with many subsections. It is said before rising to the bench, Ruth 
Bader Ginsberg (no relation; legally distinct) originally found fame as a Legis Coercitor 
by inventing the concept of movable type for her CodeHammer so she could emboss the complete 
progression of the Code ofLaw upon her enemies over time through the battles. Some examples 
of her opponents enscribed armor survive today in the military museum of the 3rd Pro Bono 
Division. The invention saw mass use in the printing press some years later after the 
Embarrassment of the Ecclesiastes, 462._[4]  
[3] _Certainly, this is what you would learn if you ask the Heirophant Supreme, 
and he should know. He wrote it, or at least that part not surviving from his predecessor. 
As your legal advisor pro tem, however, it is my duty to advise you that speaking to 
the Heirophant about this without being first being adressed by his Holy Him is a 2nd degree 
felony. He doesn't like to be disturbed._ 
[4] _In the year of Code Progression 462, Attorney Paulinus Incredulus was able to 
demonstrate in a Court of Law that in a random sampling of clergy, 93% (+-2%) could not 
even name all 19124 sections of The Code, let alone recite them. After a three week closed 
door session of the Legal Conclave  of the Succession -- oddly contemporaneous to the unexplained 
deaths of the smug 7% (+-2%) of churchpersons who passed the test --  ruled that in fact
the law was too big to be remembered by any one person. In the following year, a compromise
was reached on how to resolve the stalemate between those demanding Legal Concision and those
demanding Standardized Testing of the Clergy, and large order of CodeHammers\*\* was 
commissioned to further enlighten the populace. Neither of the predominant proposals were able 
to pass on their own merit, however._  
[5] _or so it is claimed. Few have dared do a direct head to head comparison. The devils 
are loathe to meet the Relecno directly in litigation, having been burned by them before._
