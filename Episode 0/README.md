# Episonde 0 (Session 0)

My players are a collection of teems from two family groups. It wasn't practical or time efficient to do a single
session 0 with all of them, so the initial episode was split into Group A and Group B. 

## ForestCave.md
Group A decided to be mostly of the Far Traveller background, so I had to introde a episode 0 for them that involved 
strange otherworldly portals. See FroesCave.md.  This is for 3-4 level 1 characters. Upon completion, the characters 
should advamce tp level 2. 

## OnTheRoadA.md
Group A completed their first small adventure in the cave and loved it so much, the demanded a sequel before Group B 
got to do their thing. So OnTheRoadA.md details their misadventures with slavery on their way to the meeting point
at the nascent dam. This is for 3-4 level 2 characters. No map is included. The adventure is set on the road to
the dam. It winds on the narrow strip of land with cliffside rising to the left, and lake / muddy disaster on the
right. We focus on their adventures in the narrow strip of land in the middle, euphamistically called a road. 

## ForestCaveFarm.md
This is intended to host Group B. They still haven't communicated back about choice of starting location in forest,
farm or cave, so I've had to write three introductions that lead to a shared encounter. If they survive this first
encounter, they should be promoted to level 2, with a clear idea to head towards the new dam to demand an accounting
as to why their homes/forest camp/mine was flooded out Tennessee Valley River Authority style.  (e.g. "O Brother, 
where art Though" scene at the end).
