# Foreword
This is the other session 0 start for another family of teens. It is intended to help 
them ease into their characters and clean up any rough edges and missing bits. 

In the grand scheme of things, the players are in the forest toghether for (something
drawn from their intended backgrounds). This may be a religious rite, or a coming of 
age ceremony or a big hunt, for example. The trouble starts later that evening. Unbeknownst
to the players someone has built a dam farther down the valley which is quickly flooding
the area they have bed down for the night. I gave the players the choice to start in a 
farm, forest or cave.  Which they start in is largely dungeon dressing and goes to explain
the presence and identity of the other villages with them (labelled bandits in the 
encounter -- they are friendly bandits and just use the stat block). A separate intro
appears for each, but ultimately they all end in the same frog encounter.  

At the end of the work day, the players should introduce themselves and describe what they
are doing in this location. They should tell us what we see when we look at them, and 
tell us in their own words what they think we should know about them.

The frogs are going to be a tough fight. There are a lot of them and the players are 
pretty frail. The good news is there is a lot of bandit fodder to work through first, 
and one kobold for comic relief. 

# Forest Beginning

>_After a long day of activities, your group finds itself together gathered around a
circle of logs in a small clearing overshadowed by oaks as the light dims and the Leseig
stout crickets begin their nightly song. One of the men who shares the campsite with you,
a tall brown skinned man with a sharpened bone through is nose accompanied by his (pet?)
kobold Kenny, brings a plank covered with steaming boars meat from today's successful
hunt.  Accompanying it are roasted forest mushrooms and bullrush shoots, simmered in the
drippings. A cask of small ale glitters darkly from a nearby stump. It is delicious!
Clearly the best meal yet. Some of your fellows in the firelight have filled their
drinking flasks in celebration of the end of a long day. As you eat, talk turns to a
lively story about a surprised worker who ended up tripping over a log backwards and
falling into a hole with feet waiving into the air, followed by a hasty retreat with the
squeal of an angered boar following him nearly up a tree. The discovery seems to have
prompted this evenings meal. After more stories and laughter, it is time for rest and you
each head off to your respective sleeping pads._

>_The evening is peaceful and quiet, with only the steady thrum of the Leseigs to break 
the silence. Then one by one they seem to go to sleep too, leaving silence, broken only by
the sound of sleeping men and twinkling stars peeking through the trees. In time, a low
fog begins to creep in from the lowlands, rising through and up into the bushes. A splash
is heard nearby, followed by the startled cry of a deer, and a panicked bolt through the
forest. All is still in the camp._

>_Maybe 20 minutes later, those of you still awake hear an unusual animalistic chanting
noise, "Merrr Whump." "Merr Whump!" It is low and not that loud, but repetitive and seems
to tickle your chest a bit. You also notice some of the water collecting around your
sleeping pallet adopts standing waves and a few droplets fly up into the air and drop
again back to the puddle, with each "Merr Whump!". The puddle creeps a bit to your left
and finds an old ground squirrel burrow and starts to drain down it, making a small
whirlpool in the process. You watch as a brown leaf is pulled down into the tiny tunnel.
Was there water in the campsite before? Your sleepy mind struggles to recall the water, 
but it seems as if the ground was dry and dusty._

>_"Merr Whump!"  There is another splash in the distance._ 

>_Yep! The area where the water hasn't gotten to yet is still dry and dusty. You can see
bits of dust spreading out over the surface of the water in a thin layer, like the thinnest
wax paper. A small tadpole wiggles by in front of your nose as the strange almost 
inaudible sound of water creeping in through the forest comes to your attention. Finally,
a rustle of feathers as a bird rockets towards the canopy from bushes not too far away
brings you fully awake, and none too soon too! For, a moment later comes the aborted cry 
of one of your fellow campmates, a tremendous splash not six feet from you, and the sight 
of a pair of legs sticking out of the maw of an enormous bullfrog!_


# Alternate Farm Beginning

> _After a long day's work, your little group returns to the farmstead for supper. It is the
harvest time and the head farmer has planned a surprise feast for tonight. There is fish,
and corn, and cornbread. In addition there are spiced pies made from a orange gourd local 
to the  region. Afterwards there is dancing and spiced cider! After some hours of good fun
you head exhausted to your beds._

> _Some time in the night, you are awakened to the sound of something outside making a deep
"Merrr Whump." "Merr Whump!" call. It is low and not that loud, but repetitive and seems
to tickle your chest a bit. Nearby you hear the gentle tinkle of a stream running, and then
a loud splash.  "Merr Whump!"  Pesky critters. Maybe one of the cows kicked over a milking
bucket._

> _Feeling sleepy, you roll over and try to tuck your head under the pillow. Your head is 
just a tad off the edge off the mattress giving you a view of the dusty floor below and 
your boots. One stands tall, but the other is on its side on the floor, bits of straw 
scattered around it. As you watch, a dark stain starts to creep slowly up between the 
floor boards and collect around your boots. It is shiny and reflects the moonlight streaming
in from the adjacent window._

> _Somewhat alarmed you reach down and pull your boots from the liquid and look at them. 
With some relief, you determine it is just water, and not one of the corrosive cave 
creatures you've heard about. What would they be doing under the cabin? Well, its just 
water. Your chamber pot gently floats out from under your bed and bobs over to glance 
against the wall. The water seems to be getting deeper now. That tinkling stream seems 
to have gotten louder and more violent sounding now. In the night you can hearing the 
alarmed calls of the chickens, and cows. Hopefully the farm hands can deal with it._

>_"Merr Whump!"  There is another splash in the distance._ 

> _A small tadpole wiggles by below of your nose as the strange almost 
inaudible sound of water creeping into everything comes to your attention. Finally,
there is a tremendous crash not six feet from you. An enormous bull frog has crashed
straight through the wall and landed half on your bed! With him comes a good deal of 
water flooding into your room. In his mouth is a pair of legs, still kicking, wearing
boots that you recognize as belonging to one of the farm hands!_ Roll for initiative! 

# Alternate cave Beginning

> _After many hours digging through the corners of the cave, you are relieved when the
end of the day is called. Somewhere in the cave, one of the team managed to kill a 
carrion crawler. Unbeknownst to many, the meat of a carrion crawler is quite a delicacy.
The flanks are marbled like the finest beef, has uniform thickness and comes off in nice 
square strips. It has an slightly different flavor, like mutton, but not unpleasant and
quite delicious with mint jelly! A cask of fine ale also emerges, and many of your 
fellow cavers fill their tankards with a cheer. Its been a while since you've eaten this
well and after a hard day's effort, it couldn't be better. After supper, the group settles
down to stories about cave horrors discovered in the dark, but the merry fire keeps the 
darkness away. If it wasn't for the chilly walls and ceiling, you'd think you were all 
telling ghost stories on a camping trip!_

> _The evening wears on and one by one the cavers retreat to their bedrolls. The cave 
floor is soft and sandy, almost like a dry beach, and is comfortable to lie on as long
as you have some blankets to keep you warm. You drift off to sleep watching a small cave cricket
blindly feel its way through the camp, bumping occasionally into sleeping mats before 
continuing on in its search for food in another direction._

>_"Ploink!" Your eyes open sleepily and close again. "Ploink!" again. The sound of a 
water droplet echoes in the cave around you. What is this? Chinese water torture? Well
maybe if it is, at least it isn't hitting you. Maybe it is torturing someone else. You 
drift off to sleep again._

>_"Ploink Ploink!" again. Grr. What are there two of them now? You hear the gentle sound
of something creeping through the sand, and alarmed sit up. However, it is just a tiny
rivulet of water advancing past the campsite and heading off down a side tunnel. Well
at least you didn't plunk your sleeping mat into a low spot. A dry and dusty bit of wood 
floats by on the rivulet. Well, it doesn't seem hungry. More sleep._

>_You wake again, this time to find yourself engulfed in a rush of mud and dried sticks 
pushing against your bedroll and lifitng you up. The water has risen some more and found
your bedding. The blankets are starting to feel damp. This is a problem, but not as big
of a problem as the mud and debris picking you up and carrying you off down towards the 
side passage. You aren't alone. The other cavers are all shouting and screaming. You don't 
see any monsters, but the camp seems to be slowly being taken apart by the advancing 
debris flow, backed by no small amount of water, and many of you are now floating off 
down the corridor abreast a 3 foot pile of mucky debris._

>_You and your compatriots and about eight other cavers are carried off down the tunnel
at ever increasing speeds. Ahead there is a branch in the tunnel. Most of the water is 
headed to the left, but it is wood, detritus and water is piling up on the separator
between the two tunnels, creating a large standing wave. Your pallet of debris, soggy blankets
and last night's dishes crashes up on it, before slowly rolling off to the left to follow
the main current out of the cavern. You hope it is out at least. Aren't there supposed to
be bottomless holes leading to the Underdark where a man might be lost for centuries?_

>_The water, mud and debris washes at a breakneck pace down the next tunnel. In spots, the
ceiling looks to be low and you fear losing your head to the uneven surface, but you are 
able to avoid the bigger stalactites. Some are like thin straws and break off the moment 
you touch them. Bits of the thin ones start to pile up around you with a tinkle. A few 
moments later the rush slows and the flow deposits you into a large cavern, full of water 
and debris. In the back is the pale grey light of dawn, drifting in from outside, over 
a muddly lake. In the foreground a pair of bulbous eyes meet yours. "Mee Whump!" it says.
Another one you hadn't spotted before slides off a raft of debris with a splash to 
disappear below the waves. The incoming torrent pushes you gently in their direction._ Roll
for initiative!

___
Encounter: 

The party
7 camp members (bandits )
1 kobold (kobold)
1 teddy bear (inanimate)

Swamp critters:
4 giant frogs  (50 xp each)
2 constrictor snakes (50 xp each)

After the first player turn, the pet kobold, "Kenny, no!", will run through the combat
yelling "Teddy!". He is apparently chasing his stuffed dragon which is floating through
the campsite among the mayhem. 

The first round there is only some shallow puddles, but each round the water rises 1'.
After the second round, all terrain is difficult for the players, and requires 5' of 
extra movement for each 5' travelled.  After the 5th round, the water is almost 
waist deep and movement requires an extra 10' per square. After round 10, the players 
are swimming and move at 1/3 speed and ranged weapon fire becomes impossible. Monsters
do not suffer these penalties. 

At the end of combat, if Kenny survives, he will finally capture the stuffed dragon, 
exclaiming "Got you!  Mommy! Teddy is all wet!" The kobold does not attack the monsters, 
but might climb over them to get teddy. Each round Teddy moves 2d6 squares through the
campsite in a random direction -- 1-2: counter clockwise; 3-4 over the center: 5-6 
clockwise. The kobold chases. Any roll of a 1 will hit the teddy bear (if reasonable) 
and send it flying again.

Players each get 100 bonus xp each encounter Kenny survives. 

____

>_One of the survivors from last night approaches you. "Thank you for saving us from these 
swamp things! Where did all this water come from?  I've never seen this much before here
in my life!  You must journey to the end of this lake to see why the river does not flow
from the valley any longer. I fear something terrible has occurred" Well, one thing is 
for sure. Whatever you planned to accomplish here can't be done anymore, 
unless it involves being eaten by giant frogs, You can see the valley road up hill a distance
away. The water hasn't reached it yet. Will you travel along the road up valley or down?_

The players get up to 100 xp for leaving this site and heading down river (down lake?) 
towards the apparent dam site.  This should pad them out enough to advance to level 2.
