# ForestCave beginning

## Foreword
This is part of session zero for some of the players. My players are teens, so three 
players (cleric, sorcerer, ranger) started in one family group. I asked them where they
wanted to start {forest, farm, cave} and they said a cave in the forest.  Two had selected
Far traveler as a background. The other is a dwarf, so I cobbled this together to get 
them into one place and get them talking and role playing.  This worked pretty well, but
I had some confusion since I had to unravel a little bit of the story they had concocted 
themselves about how they met so that we could roleplay the event and build more backstory.
Players are level 1.

The great part of the session 0 is that it allows the players to flesh out their characters
a bit. One of them was a cleric but had no idea who his god was. Another hadn't filled 
out the languages yet. After this adventures, they picked languages to immediately 
benefit them for this microscopic situation -- getting that hazard out of the way. The god
was revealed after some discussion to be a god of light, specifically the Dwarven God Karl. 
He was among the first dwarves to delve under the ground, and ascended when he became the
first Dwarf to be killed by a gas explosion. In this way, he became the god of light and 
surprise. On Dwarven Delver's day, followers of Karl plant small mostly harmless 
pyrotechnic traps in  chests, cabinets and other enclosures to bring about the joy and 
surprise of Karl among his followers and non-followers alike. It also brings light to 
one of the darkest days of the year. Our tabaxi was revealed to be Persian. Our halfling
appears to have blue skin following a magical accident. So, we were very successful getting
to know our characters. We had a few minutes having the players introduce their character
and what we could see about them, before the Start. 

The cave uses a small cave map with about a half dozen rooms, mostly empty and a tunnel 
leading to the surface. The empty rooms had bones, scattered rocks and some spiderwebs 
but no additional treasure. There are a few ways out of the cave. The bug bear encounter
is the hook to get them to continue on to the next stages of the adventure. If they don't
go for that find another set of hobgoblins in another room or something to ensure that 
the contract is taken from some apparent slavers that the party kills. It is useful for
some creatures from that combat to survive unconscious so that the party has the 
opportunity to become slavers themselves.

Two of the players were far travellers and enter the scene as part of a accident with 
otherwise routine planar travel. They were going through the gate to go shopping in the
city of Albuquerque (no relation), but ended up here through a routine gate accident which
may or may not have been related to the failure of the players to deliver the proper 20gp 
tip to the gate attendant. As 1st level players, we should expect they could not afford 
such a tip. Oh well! The other character was mushroom hunting. Apparently Karl has need 
for holy poisonous mushrooms for some of his observances. 

## Start 
>_Gloom. The ploink of a drop of water landing in a puddle echoes around the cavern, then
the gloom returns to silence, except for the muttering of one dwarf. He shuffles around 
in the corner of one cavern digging at the sludge which lines the cave floor with a 
thick knife. A cry of triumph "By Gloins Glowing beard! There you are!" and the figure
hunches over a bit more and attacks a hapless mushroom, soon extracting it from the mire. 
The figure swings his head around, beard extending forward with centrifugal force and he
inserts his small fungal trophy into a patch on his belt. Once done, his eyes and mouth 
slowly grow wide as one as a shimmery glow is reflected on his face._

>_Across the cavern, a magic portal glowing with daylight bows outward and settles into
a rectangular shape. The space beyond looks to be a busy city, with stone towers rising 
a half dozen stories above. The sound of carts and children playing carries into the 
cave but strangely muted and tinny. Just then, two figures stumble out of the back side of
the portal crashing into the cave wall._

>_"Oof! Hey! This isn't Albuquerque!_

>_"Rrrrreeeiiieew! Get off my tail!"_

>_THe portal winks shut, the sounds of the city gone. The silent gloom returns. Another
small drop of water falls from the roof of the cave. "Ploink!!"_

> _A female voice, "Ummm. What just happened?"_

___

>_Introductions made, you head down a side passage towards your goal. Two passages lead
from here, one northwest, one southwest._

>_Creeping into this cavern, you make out two large figures crouched over what looks to
be a pile of dead giant spiders. A thick layer of webs cover the ceiling and stretch from
ceiling to floor in the corners where the ceiling is low enough. The walls are covered 
with webs too.  Do any of you speak goblin?_

If they do speak Goblin:

>_Gorff: "Why did we stop and waste time with all the spiders. We are supposed to be
looking for slaves for market!"_
> _Gronk: "Because we need to get through this cave to get to the slaves, you oaf!"_
>_Gorff: "Fat chance we are going to get any slaves in here! We should be raiding the 
village."_
> _Gronk: "If we raid the village we'd be full of arrows by now. There are only two of us.
We are looking for young foolish slaves, venturing into this cave alone."_
>_Gorff: "Yeah, young, tasty and foolish!"_
> _Gronk: "No... not young, tasty and foolish. If you eat them then we don't get paid. 
We can buy a whole cow for the price of one slave, easy."_
>_Gorff: "Yeah, cows. Tasty slave cows..." The big one starts swinging a new in your 
direction and other one waves a big fork menacingly in your direction._


Otherwise:
> _The two figures are having a conversation in a gruff language you don't understand. A 
tall thin one has a whiny voice. The big fat one has a heavy voice, but his ability to 
speak is somewhat hindered by too many teeth. They don't seem to be paying too much 
attention to the spiders as they work through them. Mostly they just seem to be annoying
one another. After a moment, they spot you, and a wicked smile creeps on to both of their 
faces, as if to say "Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Gronk?" "Yeah, Gorff, but last time
I ate a dwarf, I was drunk for a week and lost three teeth when Gurk didn't like me chewing
on his toes!" The big one starts swinging a new in your direction and other one waves a 
big fork menacingly in your direction._

___


Encounter:  (300xp)
1 bugbear  	(6 sp)
1 hobgoblin	(2 sp)

The bugbear will try to wield a net in combat to catch the party. The hobgoblin will use
his trident to attempt to keep the players at bay (attacks mostly by held action) while 
his partner nets them one at a time. If they net a character, 1 round later they will 
attempt to grapple them into a big bag and tie it up.
___

Additional treasure: 

**Written Contract:** Gather slaves for the Relecno Corporation for Dam construction. 
Reward: 50 gp per slave for strong workers. 10 gp for adults. 50 sp for cats.

___
Encounter 2:

Wolfs den  (300xp)
1 Dire Wolf
2 wolfs

They are hungry and will attack the players on sight. They are wild creatures and cant
be tamed.  In the back of the cave is a bag of beans magical item. These are always a fun
source of chaos and give the players an out when the game gets a little too challenging. 

(My players attempted to tame these wolves and burned their entire first round, granting
the wolves effectively a surprise round. The wolves took two of them out, but ultimately
were felled by the last character.  Live and learn. Pack tactics is lethal!)

___

>_As you emerge from the caverns, you are surprised. Where once there were forests and 
farms, now only a great lake stands before you, with trees poking out if it, and a few
broken roof peaks. The road farther up the valley disappears under the water. THe road down 
the valley still looks passable though. It sticks to the edge of the rise up to the mountains 
and appears to skirt the waters as it winds off into the distance._ 

Segment Completion reward, 300 xp. This should be enough to get the three players to level
2.
