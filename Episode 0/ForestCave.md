# ForestCave beginning

>_Gloom. The ploink of a drop of water landing in a puddle echoes around the cavern, then
the gloom returns to silence, except for the muttering of one dwarf. He shuffles around 
in the corner of one cavern digging at the sludge which lines the cave floor with a 
thick knife. A cry of triumph "By Gloins Glowing beard! There you are!" and the figure
hunches over a bit more and attacks a hapless mushroom, soon extracting it from the mire. 
The figure swings his head around, beard extending forward with centrifugal force and he
inserts his small fungal trophy into a patch on his belt. Once done, his eyes and mouth 
slowly grow wide as one as a shimmery glow is reflected on his face._

>_Across the cavern, a magic portal glowing with daylight bows outward and settles into
a rectangular shape. The space beyond looks to be a busy city, with stone towers rising 
a half dozen stories above. The sound of carts and children playing carries into the 
cave but strangely muted and tinny. Just then, two figures stumble out of the back side of
the portal crashing into the cave wall._

>_"Oof! Hey! This isn't Albuquerque!_

>_"Rrrrreeeiiieew! Get off my tail!"_

>_THe portal winks shut, the sounds of the city gone. The silent gloom returns. Another
small drop of water falls from the roof of the cave. "Ploink!!"_

> _A female voice, "Ummm. What just happened?"_

___

>_Introductions made, you head down a side passage towards your goal. Two passages lead
from here, one northwest, one southwest._

>_Creeping into this cavern, you make out two large figures crouched over what looks to
be a pile of dead giant spiders. A thick layer of webs cover the ceiling and stretch from
ceiling to floor in the corners where the ceiling is low enough. The walls are covered 
with webs too.  Do any of you speak goblin?_

If they do:

>_Gorff: "Why did we stop and waste time with all the spiders. We are supposed to be
looking for slaves for market!"_
> _Gronk: "Because we need to get through this cave to get to the slaves, you oaf!"_
>_Gorff: "Fat chance we are going to get any slaves in here! We should be raiding the 
village."_
> _Gronk: "If we raid the village we'd be full of arrows by now. There are only two of us.
We are looking for young foolish slaves, venturing into this cave alone."_
>_Gorff: "Yeah, young, tasty and foolish!"_
> _Gronk: "No... not young, tasty and foolish. If you eat them then we don't get paid. 
We can buy a whole cow for the price of one slave, easy."_
>_Gorff: "Yeah, cows. Tasty slave cows..." The big one starts swinging a new in your 
direction and other one waves a big fork menacingly in your direction._


Otherwise:
> _The two figures are having a conversation in a gruff language you don't understand. A 
tall thin one has a whiny voice. The big fat one has a heavy voice, but his ability to 
speak is somewhat hindered by too many teeth. They don't seem to be paying too much 
attention to the spiders as they work through them. Mostly they just seem to be annoying
one another. After a moment, they spot you, and a wicked smile creeps on to both of their 
faces, as if to say "Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Gronk?" "Yeah, Gorff, but last time
I ate a dwarf, I was drunk for a week and lost three teeth when Gurk didn't like me chewing
on his toes!" The big one starts swinging a new in your direction and other one waves a 
big fork menacingly in your direction._

>_As you emerge from the caverns, you are surprised. Where once there were forests and 
farms, now only a great lake stands before you, with trees poking out if it, and a few
broken roof peaks. The road farther up the valley disappears under the water. THe road down 
the valley still looks passable though. It sticks to the edge of the rise up to the mountains 
and appears to skirt the waters as it winds off into the distance._
