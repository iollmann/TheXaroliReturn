# The Xaroli Return

## Campaign Setting:

Among the many nations of the world on the continent of Leseig is the the Heirophancy of
Whom, ruled by its religious patriarch, the Hierphant Supreme, Legis Lator Primus to the
Senate and final interpretor of _The Law_. It is a lawful neutral empire, with strong ties
to planes of order, not unlike Mechanus, except that the local world does not contain a
lot of complex mechanical constructs or automatons. It is just simple people, usually
doing simple things, but above all **obeying the law**. Imagine, if you will, Occidental
Fantasy Singapore and you get the idea -- schnitzel, gnomes and a liberal supply of caning. 

The national government is a theocracy run by the Hierophancy. The clerics of this order 
busy themselves by crafting ever more law to instruct the citizenry on the specifics
of how everything, _everything_ must be done. 

>_It is said in the hierophancy that if a flea is discovered on a dog's head, there is a 
statute that directs how it should be removed, who shall remove it and to whom advance
notice in writing shall be delivered and (if public notice is required) where it shall be
printed. Fun fact: At the time this saying was invented, there was in fact no such statute,
but the theocracy quickly accepted the challenge and adopted appropriate legislation in 
the following session with amendments at years 2, 4 and 7 after initial legislation._

The Heirophancy takes on all traditional aspects of government, such as maintaining the
roads, the military, and education of its population. It is especially advanced in its
employment courts, contract law, rule of law, and corrections. Unlike most places, the
prisons are especially orderly. They take great pride in enforcing structure upon the
chaotic and those with low self control, and where better to start than the prisons! The
Hierophancy is also unusual among theocracies that the **Rule of Law** is paramount over
all things, including worship and the individual whim of deities. In this, the Hierophant
Supreme is paramount, as the sole executive. Much like the American President, he
interprets and enforces the law, and acts as commander in chief. He is also the
adjudicator of last resort, nominates supreme court justices and nominates new law to the
Senate of Legis Lator, the lawmaking body of the church.

>_To be fair, clergy clerics, monks and paladins also involve themselves in many other 
activities as they see fit such as making craft beer, going on pilgrimages, and smiting 
the wicked (or overly benevolent) as needed._

As might be imagined, all citizens of the Hierophancy are _de facto_ at least passingly 
expert in the law, and part of the basic required education of the citizens is sufficient
knowledge of practice and precedent to practice law on their own behalf. Those visiting the 
Hierophancy are advised to either learn quickly or hire a solicitor on entry to avoid the
inevitable daily lawsuit concerning to their activities. 

>_**Note**: It may be supposed by the more cynical readers that certain players will want 
to stay as far away from this pillar of law and order as they possibly can! This is 
acceptable. As a practical matter, this allows certain game referees to avoid constructing 
a continent sized world sandbox and to focus instead on certain more lawless corners of the 
Hierophancy and continent of Leseig._

## The Relecno Gnome Family

Central to the current struggle in this adventure setting is the Relecno Gnome Family, 
especially one Eht Relecno, local businessman and political Boss. (Imagine a 3' tall 
proverbial Boss Hogg from the Dukes of Hazard in Medieval costume, without the politically 
insensitive Confederate themes.) The Relecno Gnome family rose to prominence due to the 
frequent disagreements between the Hierophancy and its neighboring states over their 
various treaties governing the beahvior between nations. 

>_While the Hierophancy has historically _always_ adhered to such treaties _to the letter_, 
it has also been astoundingly, yet predictably, intolerant when its counterparts did not.
There are few documents so thorough and complete as a Hierophancy negotiated treaty, which
the Hierophancy treats as a Holy Undertaking, a Divine Act of Perfection. Unfortunately 
for the surrounding nations, few outside the Hierophancy have the patience or experties to
fully understand the holy documents they participated in. This list of people especially
includes foreign leaders, all powerful men unused to impediment to their whim, who to a
man always insisted on the abbreviated version (?!), or "the general gist" of the treaty to
govern their activities. As may be predicted, the Hierophancy takes a very dim view of 
such heretical behavior, and will without hesitation go to war to ensure the law is obeyed
as a matter of holy crusade._

Initially, the Relecno Gnome family's contribution to the Hierophancy was as particularly
clever solicitors famous for their ingeniously trapped provisos in contract law. This
notoriety gained them the attention of Hierophant Semper Licitum III, a clever man always
on the lookout for well negotiated advantage, who used the Relecno Gnome Family legal team
to negotiate a new treaty over water rights with what was at the time neighboring Angola
(no relation). After the Relecnos were able to negotiate a hidden term requiring the
return of all waters not consumed by agriculture, which was a practical impossibility,
water not running on its own up hill and all that, the resultant war and annexation of
former Angola proved highly profitable (personally) to the Hierophant, and he was so
pleased, he named the Relecno Gnome family to be Negotiators of the Hierophancy. This
position proved to be so profitable in later years the Relecno Gnome family also entered
into the business of financing the wars themselves, giving them the unofficial title as
"Bankers to God". Their partnership with the Holy Bench allowed them substantial
independence within their own city-state of Lian, with near domination of the local city
council and tax authority. While many hailed their patronage of the arts and architecture, 
their local competition decried their inability to profit within the city. At times the
Relecno's ruled almost as kings within their own domain. This has attracted the attention
of the Hierophant, but for now, their privilege remains uninfringed as reciprocity for 
the considerable private intelligence garnered through attorney client privilege to the 
Legis Legatis Primus. While blackmail is of course against the law in the Hierophancy, one
can nonetheless unintentionally cultivate an implicit appearance of blackmail, if it was
in one's advantage to do so. Besides, the always clever Relecno Gnome Family has their 
other uses. 

Alas, all noble families have third sons and remote cousins. Even if you rule the 
world, only one Gnome in the family can be that ruler, and everyone else must find a place
in it or make a name for himself otherwise. And so, some twenty years prior to the current 
story, one Eht Relecno, third son to Don Relecno, Lord Solicitor to the Hierophant, left 
Lian to travel to the relatively uncivilized and lawless Rodoehtian Plateau high above the 
Hierophancy to seek his fortune, bringing Gnomish order, a business empire and tort to the 
backward yokels he found there. 

They never stood a chance. 

## Local Setting, The Rodoehtian Plateau: 
Aluffurt forest, a tropical former paradise turned on its head, featuring the 
mana rich Aluffurt tree, and associated species:

> ** Aluffurt ** - A species of palm tree local to the Rodoehtian Plateau, found nowhere 
else. It is notable for its unusual foliage, seen in a variety of pastel colors. The 
microdendritic structure is used to harvest moisture from the freezing fog that rolls down 
off the glaciers, which the tree uses as an auxiliary source of water in the dry fall and 
winter months of the year. It is amazingly soft, and as Eht Relecno has before pointed out
it "grows on trees!"  This is a major economic resource for the region, or would have been
if the locals had realized its value. Their attention has historically focussed on 
Rodoehtian Yak milk, from which a variety of local culinary delights (typically fermented 
or cultured) are produced. 

> **Rodoehtian Yak** -- Herd animal and staple resource for the region. The Rodoehtian Yak
is a long haired relative to the standard Leseigian Yak, notable for the thick lock of hair
that grows down over the nose of the beast. The lock is thought to be important to keep 
the yak's nose warm in the cold Rodoehtian winter time. It also almost completely obstructs
the beast's vision making them easier to herd while drunk on fermented Rhodoehtian Yak's 
milk. Both the fermented milk and cultured yoghurt are staple food sources in the region,
giving the Yak a level of significance nearly sufficient to rendering it the prime unit of 
currency in the region. The price of brides, land and personal debts are all measured in 
Yaks. 

> **Tawny Stoolabrabs** — The Tawny Stoolabrab is a native of Aluffurt forests, where they
nest in the trees, and consume the flavorful tree fruit, not unlike dates. Their climbing
ability and sensitive noses have been put to good use by Eht Relecno's operation who uses
them to gather the lightly magical Aluffurt fruit, part of their natural diet. A belt is
tightened around their throat so they can’t swallow the prizes.

> **Eemaws fowl** — These traditionally nest in the discarded fronds of Allufurt trees that
the instinctively gather into piles on the river shore. Sufficiently determined Eemaws 
fowl have been observed to carry the fronds the entire length of the valley to ensure proper 
bedding for their young. Since the arrival of the Relecno Gnome Family, the eemaws nests 
are  plucked clean each day so that they can never lay their eggs. The fronds are used 
in the production of a variety of clothing, in particular the Deenth, a soft garb much 
like a hoodie, but with strings at the end of the arms and full length and closed at the 
bottom. 

> **Gnimmuh fish** — a staple food. The gnimmuh fish uses its gallbladder to make a humming 
sound. After growing on a diet of Aluffurt fruits, the intestines are harvested to make 
natural Aluffurt sausages. The sausage packing is particularly cost effective since the
fish do it themselves.  The flesh itself isn’t very good, but can be smoked and used to 
feed the estate workers.

> **The Gnomes** The local area run by the Relecno Gnome family, most notably, CFO Eht 
Relecno, of the bean counter clan. These may be thought of as distant relatives to Steve
Jackson's gnomes of Zurich (Illuminati). It is said the gnomish aristocratic family has a
peculiar genetic trait -- the pupils of their eyes look like spinning gold coins. Though,
being relatively bookish and reclusive by nature it is unusual for outside sources to get
the opportunity to meet one and even then the event is usually covered by a non-disclosure
agreement. Few ever leave the employ of the bean counters to tell tales. In addition to
the luxuries productions, the family runs a local resort at which nobles and wizards come
and feast on the mana rich Aluffurt fruit and lie in best with freshly woven sheets made
of Aluffurt fruits and eemaws down. This is where Mr. Relecno is to be found, if you are
able to penetrate deep enough into the back office. 

## The plot: 
Life under the Relecno Gnome family has always revolved around money. The family rose to 
prominence as accountancy and bankers to the Hierophant Supreme, on the back of their 
(reputedly) highly profitable and increasingly complicated financial instruments. It has 
been said that the complexity and thoroughness of the contracts rivaled even those of 
the 9 Hells, though few were willing to do a direct head to head study. They amassed a 
enormous fortune financing the many Crusades of the Hierphants, and used that wealth to 
maintain enormous private estates in the city state of Leseig, and through various means 
dominate local politics there to keep tax rates on capital low.

Some 5 years ago, a promising third son to 


The party has all traveled to the resort town of Giesel, where they hope to earn their 
fortune in what they hear tale of as a village of wealth and privilege. They arrive with 
a caravan of new employees.

The manor of the Nabob: castle in which resides the nabob, gnomish lord of the region. 

The resort of the vanishing coin: where all the spoiled 2nd sons and daughters of the 
elite stay. The characters stay in the adjoining staff hostel, which as we will see is 
more hostile than hostel.

The tawny stoolabrabs pens:

Eemows fowl nests:

Gnimmuh fish farm: 


Local powers
Gnomes — local aristocrats bent on maximizing return on investment via unfettered exploitation. The lord gnome title is the nabob.
Nabob Relecno ProfitRatchet — gold coin eyes, ears vastly over grown due to a excessively mana rich diet. Must wear a turban with ear hammocks to manage the weight and prevent floppy Dopey ears.
Xarol — “crazed” environmentalist who want to end all the “fun”. He lives in the adjacent quixotic quagmire.
Whacker goblin tribe — allies of the nabob. Goblins do much of the work on the plantation, keeping the stoolabrabs  on task, netting the Gnimmuh fish and plucking the eemows fowl. The chief Whacker has a fat belly and alarmingly large ears himself. However being a goblin, these are more bat like and give him the power of limited flight in a fracas.
The Kings Taxing Authority (KTA) — suspects the Nabob has been elevating the price of his holdings for borrowing purposes while at the same time keeping it low for tax purposes. May provide one party member with a secret mission to collect evidence of tax fraud.
Former adventuring 	party of Nabob ProfitRatchet —
Druid Xarol — now known as Xarol.
Kurt Brandstetter — personal guard of Nabob ProfitRatchet. Wears an iron mask due to facial burns sustained in combat. Kurt has been around and seen it all. If the party could see his expressions through the mask, he would be smirking or making faces at ProfitRatchet’s more outrageous excesses.
Wendel Sorebottom — court mage. Always stands. Original designer of the quest to crush the Aluffurt forest for fun and profit. It was previously guarded by elves. The elves were slain in a combined attack by the adventuring party and the Whacker tribe. This set Xarol off on his separate path.	

Ruined Elvenhome (SchlopGlup Desolation) in the quixotic quagmire — populated by the ghosts of the former protectors of the Aluffurt forest.

Side quest kill harpies — harpies are eating the tawny stoolabrabs. They swoop down and capture them while they are collecting Aluffurt fruits from the top of the Aluffurt trees, and carry them back to their nests in the mesa cliffs above.
