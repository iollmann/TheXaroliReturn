# The Xaroli Return

## Campaign Setting:

Among the many nations of the world on the continent of Leseig is the the Heirophancy of
Whom, ruled by its religious patriarch, the Hierphant Supreme, Legis Lator Primus to the
Senate and final interpretor of _The Law_. It is a lawful neutral empire, with strong ties
to planes of order, not unlike Mechanus, except that the local world does not contain a
lot of complex mechanical constructs or automatons. It is just simple people, usually
doing simple things, but above all **obeying the law**. Imagine, if you will, Occidental
Fantasy Singapore and you get the idea -- schnitzel, gnomes and a liberal supply of caning. 

The national government is a theocracy run by the Hierophancy. The clerics of this order 
busy themselves by crafting ever more law to instruct the citizenry on the specifics
of how everything, _everything_ must be done. 

>_It is said in the hierophancy that if a flea is discovered on a dog's head, there is a 
statute that directs how it should be removed, who shall remove it and to whom advance
notice in writing shall be delivered and (if public notice is required) where it shall be
printed. Fun fact: At the time this saying was invented, there was in fact no such statute,
but the theocracy quickly accepted the challenge and adopted appropriate legislation in 
the following session with amendments at years 2, 4 and 7 after initial legislation._

The Heirophancy takes on all traditional aspects of government, such as maintaining the
roads, the military, and education of its population. It is especially advanced in its
employment courts, contract law, rule of law, and corrections. Unlike most places, the
prisons are especially orderly. They take great pride in enforcing structure upon the
chaotic and those with low self control, and where better to start than the prisons! The
Hierophancy is also unusual among theocracies that the **Rule of Law** is paramount over
all things, including worship and the individual whim of deities. In this, the Hierophant
Supreme is paramount, as the sole executive. Much like the American President, he
interprets and enforces the law, and acts as commander in chief. He is also the
adjudicator of last resort, nominates supreme court justices and nominates new law to the
Senate of Legis Lator, the lawmaking body of the church.

>_To be fair, clergy clerics, monks and paladins also involve themselves in many other 
activities as they see fit such as making craft beer, going on pilgrimages, and smiting 
the wicked (or overly benevolent) as needed._

As might be imagined, all citizens of the Hierophancy are _de facto_ at least passingly 
expert in the law, and part of the basic required education of the citizens is sufficient
knowledge of practice and precedent to practice law on their own behalf. Those visiting the 
Hierophancy are advised to either learn quickly or hire a solicitor on entry to avoid the
inevitable daily lawsuit concerning to their activities. 

>_**Note**: It may be supposed by the more cynical readers that certain players will want 
to stay as far away from this pillar of law and order as they possibly can! This is 
acceptable. As a practical matter, this allows certain game referees to avoid constructing 
a continent sized world sandbox and to focus instead on certain more lawless corners of the 
Hierophancy and continent of Leseig._

## The Relecno Gnome Family

Central to the current struggle in this adventure setting is the Relecno Gnome Family, 
especially one Eht Relecno, local businessman and political Boss. (Imagine a 3' tall 
proverbial Boss Hogg from the Dukes of Hazard in Medieval costume, without the politically 
insensitive Confederate themes.) The Relecno Gnome family rose to prominence due to the 
frequent disagreements between the Hierophancy and its neighboring states over their 
various treaties governing the beahvior between nations. 

>_While the Hierophancy has historically _always_ adhered to such treaties _to the letter_, 
it has also been astoundingly, yet predictably, intolerant when its counterparts did not.
There are few documents so thorough and complete as a Hierophancy negotiated treaty, which
the Hierophancy treats as a Holy Undertaking, a Divine Act of Perfection. Unfortunately 
for the surrounding nations, few outside the Hierophancy have the patience or experties to
fully understand the holy documents they participated in. This list of people especially
includes foreign leaders, all powerful men unused to impediment to their whim, who to a
man always insisted on the abbreviated version (?!), or "the general gist" of the treaty to
govern their activities. As may be predicted, the Hierophancy takes a very dim view of 
such heretical behavior, and will without hesitation go to war to ensure the law is obeyed
as a matter of holy crusade._

Initially, the Relecno Gnome family's contribution to the Hierophancy was as particularly
clever solicitors famous for their ingeniously trapped provisos in contract law. This
notoriety gained them the attention of Hierophant Semper Licitum III, a clever man always
on the lookout for well negotiated advantage, who used the Relecno Gnome Family legal team
to negotiate a new treaty over water rights with what was at the time neighboring Angola
(no relation). After the Relecnos were able to negotiate a hidden term requiring the
return of all waters not consumed by agriculture, which was a practical impossibility,
water not running on its own up hill and all that, the resultant war and annexation of
former Angola proved highly profitable (personally) to the Hierophant, and he was so
pleased, he named the Relecno Gnome family to be Negotiators of the Hierophancy. This
position proved to be so profitable in later years the Relecno Gnome family also entered
into the business of financing the wars themselves, giving them the unofficial title as
"Bankers to God". Their partnership with the Holy Bench allowed them substantial
independence within their own city-state of Lian, with near domination of the local city
council and tax authority. While many hailed their patronage of the arts and architecture, 
their local competition decried their inability to profit within the city. At times the
Relecno's ruled almost as kings within their own domain. This has attracted the attention
of the Hierophant, but for now, their privilege remains uninfringed as reciprocity for 
the considerable private intelligence garnered through attorney client privilege to the 
Legis Legatis Primus. While blackmail is of course against the law in the Hierophancy, one
can nonetheless unintentionally cultivate an implicit appearance of blackmail, if it was
in one's advantage to do so. Besides, the always clever Relecno Gnome Family has their 
other uses. 

Alas, all noble families have third sons and remote cousins. Even if you rule the 
world, only one Gnome in the family can be that ruler, and everyone else must find a place
in it or make a name for himself otherwise. And so, some twenty years prior to the current 
story, one Eht Relecno, third son to Don Relecno, Lord Solicitor to the Hierophant, left 
Lian to travel to the relatively uncivilized and lawless Rodoehtian Plateau high above the 
Hierophancy to seek his fortune, bringing Gnomish order, a business empire and tort to the 
backward yokels he found there. 

They never stood a chance. 

## Local Setting, The Rodoehtian Plateau: 
Aluffurt forest, a tropical former paradise turned on its head, featuring the 
mana rich Aluffurt tree, and associated species:

> **Aluffurt** - A species of palm tree local to the Rodoehtian Plateau, found nowhere 
else. It is notable for its unusual foliage, seen in a variety of pastel colors. The 
microdendritic structure is used to harvest moisture from the freezing fog that rolls down 
off the glaciers, which the tree uses as an auxiliary source of water in the dry fall and 
winter months of the year. It is amazingly soft, and as Eht Relecno has before pointed out
it "grows on trees!"  This is a major economic resource for the region, or would have been
if the locals had realized its value. Their attention has historically focussed on 
Rodoehtian Yak milk, from which a variety of local culinary delights (typically fermented 
or cultured) are produced. 

> **Rodoehtian Yak** -- Herd animal and staple resource for the region. The Rodoehtian Yak
is a long haired relative to the standard Leseigian Yak, notable for the thick lock of hair
that grows down over the nose of the beast. The lock is thought to be important to keep 
the yak's nose warm in the cold Rodoehtian winter time. It also almost completely obstructs
the beast's vision making them easier to herd while drunk on fermented Rhodoehtian Yak's 
milk. Both the fermented milk and cultured yoghurt are staple food sources in the region,
giving the Yak a level of significance nearly sufficient to rendering it the prime unit of 
currency in the region. The price of brides, land and personal debts are all measured in 
Yaks. 

> **Tawny Stoolabrabs** — The Tawny Stoolabrab is a native of Aluffurt forests, where they
nest in the trees, and consume the flavorful tree fruit, not unlike dates. Their climbing
ability and sensitive noses have been put to good use by Eht Relecno's operation who uses
them to gather the lightly magical Aluffurt fruit, part of their natural diet. A belt is
tightened around their throat so they can’t swallow the prizes.

> **Eemaws fowl** — These traditionally nest in the discarded fronds of Allufurt trees that
the instinctively gather into piles on the river shore. Sufficiently determined Eemaws 
fowl have been observed to carry the fronds the entire length of the valley to ensure proper 
bedding for their young. Since the arrival of the Relecno Gnome Family, the eemaws nests 
are  plucked clean each day so that they can never lay their eggs. The fronds are used 
in the production of a variety of clothing, in particular the Deenth, a soft garb much 
like a hoodie, but with strings at the end of the arms and full length and closed at the 
bottom. 

> **Gnimmuh fish** — a staple food. The gnimmuh fish uses its gallbladder to make a humming 
sound. After growing on a diet of Aluffurt fruits, the intestines are harvested to make 
natural Aluffurt sausages. The sausage packing is particularly cost effective since the
fish do it themselves.  The flesh itself isn’t very good, but can be smoked and used to 
feed the estate workers.

> **The Gnomes** The local area run by the Relecno Gnome family, most notably, CFO Eht 
Relecno, of the bean counter clan. These may be thought of as distant relatives to Steve
Jackson's gnomes of Zurich (Illuminati). It is said the gnomish aristocratic family has a
peculiar genetic trait -- the pupils of their eyes look like spinning gold coins. Though,
being relatively bookish and reclusive by nature it is unusual for outside sources to get
the opportunity to meet one and even then the event is usually covered by a non-disclosure
agreement. Few ever leave the employ of the bean counters to tell tales. In addition to
the production of luxuries, the family runs a local resort at which nobles and wizards come
and feast on the mana rich Aluffurt fruit and lie in best with freshly woven sheets made
of Aluffurt fruits and eemaws down. This is where Mr. Relecno is to be found, if you are
able to penetrate deep enough into the back office to find him. 

> **The Rodoehtian Plateau**  It is best to think of the Rodoehtian Plateau as something
akin to the Tibetan plateau, but without the Dalai Lama. It is the highest region in 
Leseig and consists of a single large valley about 60 miles long, with a river that runs 
the length of it and steep mountains rising to impossible heights on either side. The 
entrance to the valley is traversed by a road consisting almost entirely of switchbacks --
431 of them! -- which few merchants are willing traverse. While there have been some 
military expeditions from the Hierophancy to attempt to bring law and order to the high
valley in their own backyard, the peoples there are largely uneducated, neither able to 
read nor write, and consequently have been quite naively resistant to mastering The Law. 
In addition, the altitude is so extreme that the weather can be quite severe in winter,
and the air so thin that expeditionary forces typically are unwilling to do much more than
stand around. Women from the lowlands are also unable to carry a pregnancy to term, so 
often within a few years, the commander engineers his recall to society and the garrison
leaves with him, "for his personal protection". The valley is currently enjoying some 
respite from theocratic control at the moment, though the recent arrival of Eht Relecno 
seems likely to result in some excitement beyond the traditional Yak festival and the 
passing of the seasons.


### Cast of Characters
Life under the Relecno Gnome family has always revolved around money. The family rose to 
prominence as accountancy and bankers to the Hierophant Supreme, on the back of their 
(reputedly) highly profitable and increasingly complicated financial instruments. It has 
been said that the complexity and thoroughness of the contracts rivaled even those of 
the 9 Hells, though few have been willing to do a direct head to head study. They amassed a 
enormous fortune financing the many Crusades of the Hierphants, and used that wealth to 
maintain palacial private estates in the city state of Lian within the Hierophancy, and 
through various means dominate local politics there to keep tax rates on capital low.

**Eht Relecno ()** -- Some 20 years ago, a promising third son to Don Relecno, Lord
Solicitor to the Hierophant, Eht Relecno, left Lian to travel to the Rodoehtian Plateau to
subjugate the natives / seek his fortune. After spending some years setting up a law
practice at the foot of the valley to bring spiritual enlightment to the natives (most of
Whom never heard of law, instead relying on a complex oral tradition of obligation and
taboo), he worked with the single priest of the Hierophancy stationed in the region to
bring about a court system, which Eht now presides over. He currently rules over a
business empire looking to exploit the area's natural resources for consumption and export
to the Hierophancy. He also has his own more sinister agenda going behind the scenes
intended to give him immortality. After watching his father for many years, he has
concluded the man's prime qualification for the job is his advanced age -- Don Relecno is
389 years old -- and Eht wagers he can eventually inherit the position _permanently_ if he
can find a way to cheat death. Who knows? Perhaps the position of Hierophancy Supreme will
eventually await?  It has in the past been occupied by former pirates, slavers and
murderers. Surely, a rich man may speak for the the kingdom of heaven?

**Legitus Legitus** (Cleric 4)-- The human priest, Legitus Legitus, is optimistic but
wary. He fully knows who he is collaborating with, or at least his family history. 
Legitus Legitus is a simple man. He is hoping his assignment to the Rodoehtian will result
in some recognition from the Hierophancy -- he really thinks _Everybody ought to have a
maid_ (sing it with me!) -- but the practical realities on how to translate the best
qualities of the region to success, profit and most of all wealth so he can afford
servants of his own are lost on him. Left to his own devices, Legitus Legitus is an
inwardly focused man, delighted with toying with interactions between obscure corners of
the law. The majesty of his natural surroundings -- the Allufurt forests and creatures
within -- are lost on him.  His wife, **Magna Nasa**, is ever pushing him to political
success within the hierarchy. However, his current assignment in the remote Rodoehtian
Plateau may be as much do to the Hierophancy's appreciation of her qualities as his. If
the characters decide to fight Relecno in court, Legitus Legitus, the only other qualified
barrister in town will likely agree to represent them so as to preserve the tenet of
qualified representation under the law. His services will be _pro bono_ if the party is
subject to prosecution.

**The Yokel Tribe** -- The local tribesmen are collectively called Yokels. They are 
farmers and herdsmen, favoring the Rodoehtian Yak for their butter, yoghurt and fermented
Yaks milk. THe breed is easy to watch over and makes a nice milk, if a bit grass flavored. 
They prize Yaks, peace, beautiful daughters and Yaks, in that order. The Yokels have a 
rich oral tradition of stories, involving local heroes and the tall peaks surrounding 
their valley. Yaks always figure prominently in the tales, either as rewards, or a source
for crisis, or as friends perhaps for comic relief. The Yokels have no chief. They find
it easier to deal with the Hierophancy if there is no one for the Hierophancy to deal 
with.

**Hobgoblins** -- A tribe of hobgoblins (with a few bugbear friends) inhabits the valley.
Traditionally they have lived in the caves in remote corners of the valley, occasionally
emerging to raid local villages for slaves and meat. However, Eht Relecno seems to have 
managed to create a business relationship with the local chief and they may be found 
working in his employ wherever tough guys are needed. 


### The Plot:

At the beginning of the adventure, Eht Relcno has run into a problem. He is having trouble
harvesting Allufurt trees fast enough because the local Yokel tribe is too busy watching
their Yaks and can't be convinced, bribed or coerced to abandon them in favor of chopping
down trees.  If pressed, they simply disappear into the forests with their axes and can be
found a few days later back with their herds again. The Yokels really do love their Yaks!

The ever enterprising Eht has however learned of the proclivity of the native Eemaws swan
to strip the choice Allufurt branches to line their nests in the shores of local ponds. 
Unfortunately, these are too far from the factory, and the lengthy round trip between 
nest and warehouse is logistically challenging limiting production. Instead Eht has come
up with awful idea, a _wonderful awful_ idea to fill in the Eeemaws roosting ponds with 
rubble and instead dam the Rodoehtian river near his factory to make the only roosting 
sites for the birds right next to his factory. He reasons the fowl can fly the fronds 
to the factory vicinity faster than he can truck them by cart, so lets get them to do 
the work for free. Consequently, he has caused a dam to be built flooding the entire 
valley. He has not factored in the idea that the unknown PCs may take this poorly. The
local Yokels have historically been extremely passive in their dealings with the 
Hierophancy, typically resorting to a zen-like political judo in their passive resistance
to the litigious theocracy. He hasn't yet realized what havoc the waters are playing with
the now flooded Allufurt forests upstream. 

Now that the dam has been constructed, Eht is now looking for slaves to build artificial 
Eemaws fowl nesting sites in flat areas near the dam. Once complete, the slaves will be
responsible for harvesting all of the Allufurt fronds brought in by the nesting Eemaws 
fowl and bringing them down the back side of the dam to the factory, where they can be
converted to fashion accessories and the valley's own inscrutable product, the deenth. 

**The Deenth** -- Eht is the inventor of the deenth, and seems to think that it will be 
amazing and the most useful thing ever, but nobody around him seems to get it. It is a 
trench coat like design with long cords on the sleeves, presumably to tie on mittens. Most 
inexplicably, the bottom where your legs would stick out is sewn closed with a proprietary 
method that leaves the seam invisible. 

Along the way Eht has a secret side project going on, his own immortality. He has made a 
deal with a Devil () to 


The party has all traveled to the resort town of Giesel, where they hope to earn their 
fortune in what they hear tale of as a village of wealth and privilege. They arrive with 
a caravan of new employees.

The manor of the Nabob: castle in which resides the nabob, gnomish lord of the region. 

The resort of the vanishing coin: where all the spoiled 2nd sons and daughters of the 
elite stay. The characters stay in the adjoining staff hostel, which as we will see is 
more hostile than hostel.

The tawny stoolabrabs pens:

Eemows fowl nests:

Gnimmuh fish farm: 


Local powers
Gnomes — local aristocrats bent on maximizing return on investment via unfettered exploitation. The lord gnome title is the nabob.
Nabob Relecno ProfitRatchet — gold coin eyes, ears vastly over grown due to a excessively mana rich diet. Must wear a turban with ear hammocks to manage the weight and prevent floppy Dopey ears.
Xarol — “crazed” environmentalist who want to end all the “fun”. He lives in the adjacent quixotic quagmire.
Whacker goblin tribe — allies of the nabob. Goblins do much of the work on the plantation, keeping the stoolabrabs  on task, netting the Gnimmuh fish and plucking the eemows fowl. The chief Whacker has a fat belly and alarmingly large ears himself. However being a goblin, these are more bat like and give him the power of limited flight in a fracas.
The Kings Taxing Authority (KTA) — suspects the Nabob has been elevating the price of his holdings for borrowing purposes while at the same time keeping it low for tax purposes. May provide one party member with a secret mission to collect evidence of tax fraud.
Former adventuring 	party of Nabob ProfitRatchet —
Druid Xarol — now known as Xarol.
Kurt Brandstetter — personal guard of Nabob ProfitRatchet. Wears an iron mask due to facial burns sustained in combat. Kurt has been around and seen it all. If the party could see his expressions through the mask, he would be smirking or making faces at ProfitRatchet’s more outrageous excesses.
Wendel Sorebottom — court mage. Always stands. Original designer of the quest to crush the Aluffurt forest for fun and profit. It was previously guarded by elves. The elves were slain in a combined attack by the adventuring party and the Whacker tribe. This set Xarol off on his separate path.	

Ruined Elvenhome (SchlopGlup Desolation) in the quixotic quagmire — populated by the ghosts of the former protectors of the Aluffurt forest.

Side quest kill harpies — harpies are eating the tawny stoolabrabs. They swoop down and capture them while they are collecting Aluffurt fruits from the top of the Aluffurt trees, and carry them back to their nests in the mesa cliffs above.
