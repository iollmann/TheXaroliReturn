# TheXaroliReturn

This is a D&D 5e (2014 ed.) adventure that borrows a popular children's story for its background.
It is intended for 4-6 players. Since my players are teens and come from two family groups, 
session 0 is split into group A and group B segments to deal with the fact that some of
the players are adventuring separately from the other group at first. They will meet up later.
The characters are level 1 to start. I allowed character concepts from any official published 
WoTC  rule / source book. Unearthed Arcana was disallowed.
