# The Xaroli Return

This is a D&D 5e (2014 ed.) adventure that borrows from a popular children's story for its setting.
It is intended for 4-6 players. Since my players are teens and come from two family groups, 
session 0 is split into group A and group B segments to deal with the fact that some of
the players are adventuring separately from the other group at first. They will meet up later.
With several session 0 onramps, you may be able to use these to dovetail with your current 
campaign setting. The characters are level 1 to start, and will advance in a milestone fashion 
as the story progresses. I allowed character concepts from any official published WoTC  rule / 
source book. Unearthed Arcana was disallowed. No established pantheon is prescribed.  Since there 
is not a strong religious component to this adventure, players were allowed to invent their own 
(sometimes comical) deities to worship as needed. I find this makes religion less heavy and is 
often a deep soure of unexpected mirth in a campaign for young people. 

This adventure develops several themes such as violence, slavery, environment destruction, rough 
treatment of animals, and equally crass exploitation of humanoids by the local elite and their 
henchmen. At times, player characters may find themselves in the position of choosing to (be 
employed to) commit such acts themselves. It is up to them to navigate through the moral 
and financial morass as protagonists of _this_ story. The adventure will not go out of its way 
to reward or penalize such behavior, except with the predictable natural outcome for such activities.
(E.g. Rob a bank and earn the contents and the ire of the local population.) The identity of 
the children's story that provides the setting is not revealed so as not to overly prompt specific 
behaviors, except perhaps as a fun reveal at the end. What _have_ you done, children?
